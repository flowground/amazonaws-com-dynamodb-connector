    "description": "Amazon DynamoDB Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that\nprovides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. DynamoDB\nlets you offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a\ndistributed database, so that you don't have to worry about hardware\nprovisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software patching, or\ncluster scaling.\n\nWith DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any\namount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. You can scale up or\nscale down your tables' throughput capacity without downtime or performance\ndegradation, and use the AWS Management Console to monitor resource utilization\nand performance metrics.\n\nDynamoDB automatically spreads the data and traffic for your tables over a\nsufficient number of servers to handle your throughput and storage requirements,\nwhile maintaining consistent and fast performance. All of your data is stored on\nsolid state disks (SSDs) and automatically replicated across multiple\nAvailability Zones in an AWS region, providing built-in high availability and\ndata durability.",
